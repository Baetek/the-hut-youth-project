<p>
    The Hut has worked with young people since 1987,
providing effective youth work practice. This is
achieved through a wide range of activities, planning,
personal and social development.
</p>
<p>
    Young people attend The Hut because they know
they are in a place that promotes relationship
building in a safe, fun and friendly environment.
</p>
<p>
    Our aim is to “Do what’s possible and Try what’s not”
through inspiring them to reach their potential while
becoming better active citizens.
</p>

<p>
    Hopefully, you are now wondering how we will achieve this.
    <ul>
    <li>
        Opening when young people want the building available to them, so
late night provision around weekends is a must for them.

    </li>
        <li>
Creating opportunities that they plan not just within their own com-
munities but the wider world.
